      <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was an extraordinary mathematician and writer. She is famed for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and for being the first to recognize that a machine could follow a sequence of instructions, making her the world’s first computer programmer.
      </p>
      <h2>What I Admire</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace was a visionary who saw beyond her time. Her ability to imagine possibilities for computing that even Babbage did not foresee is deeply inspiring. Her resilience in a male-dominated field and her lifelong pursuit of knowledge encourage us all to keep learning and innovating.
